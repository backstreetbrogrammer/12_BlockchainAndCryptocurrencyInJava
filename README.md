# Blockchain and Cryptocurrency in Java

> Blockchain is a peer-to-peer decentralized distributed ledger technology that makes the records of any digital asset
> transparent and unchangeable and works without involving any third-party intermediary.

In simpler words, the blockchain is an **immutable** (unchangeable, meaning a transaction or file recorded cannot be
changed) distributed digital **ledger** (digital record of transactions or data stored in multiple places on a computer
network).

An **asset** can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights,
branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting
costs for all involved.

> A cryptocurrency is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is
> not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.
> It is a decentralized system for verifying that the parties to a transaction have the money they claim to have,
> eliminating the need for traditional intermediaries, such as banks, when funds are being transferred between
> two entities.

In simpler words, cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by **cryptography**, which makes it
nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain
technology â€” a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.
